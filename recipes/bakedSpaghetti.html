    <h3>How to make the Baked Spaghetti:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt; cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add ground meat mix and 1 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring occasionally to crumble, until well browned and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Add marinara sauce and basil; cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining 2 teaspoons garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add heavy cream; cook, whisking often, until thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and gradually whisk in Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Transfer pasta and cream mixture to a greased 13x 9 baking dish; toss gently to combine. Spread meat sauce evenly over pasta and sprinkle with mozzarella and crushed red pepper, if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and mozzarella is lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
